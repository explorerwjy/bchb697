(2002)} investigated whether haplotypes A or B of the cystatin C gene were genetically associated with exudative age-related macular degeneration in a Caucasian population. Cystatin C is a cysteine protease inhibitor that regulates the activity of cathepsin S ({116845}), a protease with central regulatory functions in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. They found no significant difference in allele frequencies between patients and controls. There was a significant difference in genotype counts between patients and controls, which could be explained completely by an excess of the homozygous CST3 genotype B/B (ala25-to-thr; {604312.0002}) in patients (6.6%) over controls (2.3%), suggesting an odds ratio for ARMD in association with CST3 B/B of 2.97 (95% CI, 1.28-6.86). The mean disease-free survival time in pooled males and females with genotypes A/A or A/B was 85 years, and with genotype B/B, 76 years. {3:Zurdel et al. (2002)} concluded that CST3 haplotype B may be a recessive risk allele, significantly contributing to disease risk in up to 6.6% of German ARMD patients.\n\n{1:Paraoan et al. (2004)} found that proper targeting of cystatin C to the Golgi apparatus and processing through the secretory pathway of RPE cells was dependent upon the 26-amino acid signal sequence of precursor cystatin C. In contrast, they found that the A25T (haplotype B) variant of cystatin C was associated principally with mitochondria with some diffusion throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus (but not nucleoli).\n\n{2:Ratnayaka et al. (2007)} created an artificial mutant A25S precursor cystatin C to elucidate the cause of intracellular mislocalization of the biochemically related variant B (A25T) precursor cystatin C to the mitochondria. A25S precursor cystatin C showed a dual distribution to the Golgi apparatus and to the mitochondria. Furthermore, the level of secretion of A25S cystatin C by RPE cells was intermediary between the wildtype and the ARMD-associated cystatin C. {2:Ratnayaka et al. (2007)} stated that their findings further supported the hypothesis that substitution of the ala25 residue with a less hydrophobic residue such as threonine or serine was sufficient to impair the intracellular trafficking and processing of the protein.", "textSectionName": "molecularGenetics"}}], "editHistory": "carol : 04/15/2008\ncarol : 4/15/2008", "phenotypicSeriesExists": true, "creationDate": "Jane Kelly : 4/15/2008", "epochUpdated": 1208242800, "dateUpdated": "Tue, 15 Apr 2008 03:00:00 EDT", "referenceList": [{"reference": {"articleUrl": "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1398-9219&date=2004&volume=5&issue=11&spage=884", "publisherName": "Blackwell Publishing", "title": "Unexpected intracellular localization of the AMD-associated cystatin C variant.", "mimNumber": 611953, "referenceNumber": 1, "publisherAbbreviation": "Blackwell", "pubmedID": 15479453, "source": "Traffic 5: 884-895, 2004.", "authors": "Paraoan, L., Ratnayaka, A., Spiller, D.
