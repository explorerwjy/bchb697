Among 123 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Cowden or Cowden-like syndrome without germline PTEN, SDHB ({185470}), or SDHD ({602690}) mutations, {1:Bennett et al. (2010)} found that 45 (37%) had germline hypermethylation and epigenetic inactivation of the KILLIN promoter. Of the 45 patients, 20 had classic Cowden syndrome, and 25 had Cowden-like syndrome. Hypermethylation of this region was not observed in 50 controls. One proband had a family history of the disorder, and genetic analysis showed that 3 of the 4 affected family members also had germline methylation in this region. Germline methylation was found to transcriptionally downregulate KLLN expression 250-fold, and exclusively disrupted TP53 activation of KLLN by 30%. Analysis of clinical features showed that individuals with KLLN promoter methylation had a 3-fold increased prevalence of breast cancer and a greater than 2-fold increase of kidney cancer compared to individuals with germline PTEN mutations. {1:Bennett et al.
