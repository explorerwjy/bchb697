(1998)} in which HNPCC was associated with germline mutation of the TGFBR2 gene (T315M; {190182.0002}), loss of wildtype fragments was observed in the tumor of the proband. It was unknown whether the affected brothers of the proband also carried the variant because tumor tissue samples from them were unavailable. The variant was present in 2 of the proband's 6 children, but they had not developed cancer. Functional assays demonstrated that the mutant TGFBR2 protein could not restore growth inhibition in response to TGF-beta ({190180}). The tumor of the proband exhibited loss of heterozygosity in chromosomes 5q, 17p, and 18q without alteration in 10 microsatellite loci, MLH1 ({120436}), MSH2 ({609309}), MSH3 ({600887}), or at the TGFBR2 (A)10 repeat sequence. Coupled with the lack of multiple synchronous, metachronous colorectal cancers or extracolonic cancers in this family, these data showed that the tumorigenic pathway in this kindred is different from the mutator pathway in typical HNPCC tumorigenesis.\n\nSomatic mutation in the TGFBR2 gene has been found in HNPCC (e.g., {3:Markowitz et al.
