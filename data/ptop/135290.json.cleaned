(1992)} described a mother and son with marked infiltrative fibromatosis of the mesentery of the type that had been observed as part of the Gardner syndrome. However, colonic polyps, osteomas, sebaceous cysts, and congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) typical of Gardner syndrome were not observed. In the mother, the diagnosis of infiltrative fibromatosis of the mesentery was made at age 30. Barium enema was negative for colonic polyps. She died at 32 years of age of bowel perforation and intractable abdominal sepsis; no colonic polyps were discovered postmortem. The son was found to have an abdominal mass at age 14 years. Colonoscopic examination was negative, and other extracolonic features of Gardner syndrome were not found. Family history revealed a maternal history of nonpolyposis colon cancer syndrome and breast tumor. {5:Maher et al. (1992)} noted that affected members of this family may have had a mutation at the APC locus that predisposed them to the development of desmoid tumor and perhaps colon cancer, but not multiple polyposis.\n\n{2:Eccles et al. (1996)} described a family in which members of 3 generations showed hereditary desmoid disease characterized by multifocal fibromatosis of the paraspinal muscles, breast, occiput, arms, lower ribs, abdominal wall, and mesentery. The authors stated that some of these locations were unusual for desmoids observed in classic FAP, which usually occur in the bowel or abdominal wall. Osteomas and epidermal cysts were also observed. One patient developed carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. None of the patients had classic colonic polyposis, but 1 had a small number (less than 50) colonic polyps and 3 had fundic gland polyps. {2:Eccles et al. (1996)} proposed the name 'hereditary desmoid disease.' In an accompanying editorial, {4:Lynch (1996)} suggested that the family reported by {2:Eccles et al. (1996)} had an attenuated form of FAP with a high predilection for the development of desmoid tumors.\n\n{1:Couture et al. (2000)} described a large French-Canadian family with hereditary desmoid disease. The phenotype was characterized by the early onset of multiple desmoid tumors arising near the axial skeleton and in proximal extremities. Although the penetrance of desmoid tumors was nearly 100%, the expression of the disease was variable among the different affected relatives. The most severely affected patient died due to persistent tumor growth in the cervical spine area, while other patients had an indolent course of disease with lesions located mainly on the proximal limbs. The proband who brought the family to attention was found to have a mass in the neck region at the age of 28 years. She subsequently developed multifocal tumors in the cervical area, occiput, arms, breast, and the thoracic paraspinal area. The initial lesions on the neck and extremities were excised, but disease relapse occurred at both local and distant sites. At the age of 46 years, the patient had good functional status with minor to moderate disability. Her son developed 3 lesions on his right upper extremity at 18 years. Her daughter had 1 lesion on the upper extremity at 16 years. Many gene carriers also had cutaneous cysts.

Affected members of 2 other apparently unrelated families with desmoid tumors had the same mutation, and haplotype analysis suggested a common origin. {7:Scott et al. (1996)} concluded that FAP and hereditary desmoid disease are allelic, and that APC mutations that truncate the APC protein distal to the beta-catenin-binding domain are associated with desmoid tumors, absence of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, and variable but attenuated polyposis expression.\n\nIn affected members of a family with hereditary desmoid disease, {2:Eccles et al.
