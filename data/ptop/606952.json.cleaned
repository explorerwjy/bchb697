Severe nystagmus, photophobia, and reduced visual acuity are common features. OCA type I is divided into 2 types: type IA, characterized by complete lack of tyrosinase activity due to production of an inactive enzyme, and type IB, characterized by reduced activity of tyrosinase.\n\nAlthough OCA caused by mutations in the TYR gene was classically known as 'tyrosinase-negative' OCA, {12:Tripathi et al. (1992)} noted that some patients with 'tyrosinase-positive' OCA may indeed have TYR mutations resulting in residual enzyme activity. These patients can be classified as having OCA1B.", "textSectionName": "description"}}, {"textSection": {"textSectionTitle": "Clinical Features", "textSectionContent": "{13:Witkop (1971)} suggested that the 'yellow mutant' (ym) form of albinism first observed among the Amish ({10:Nance et al., 1970}) and later observed in non-Amish families ({15:Witkop et al., 1971}) may be distinct from both tyrosinase-positive and tyrosinase-negative albinism. As in type II albinism ({203200}), the homozygote is 'dead white' at birth, with serious ocular abnormalities, but rather rapidly develops normal skin pigmentation and yellow hair. The condition differs from albinism II in the yellow hair and the fact that incubation with L-tyrosine or L-DOPA yields equivocal results.\n\n{4:Hu et al. (1980)} described 3 sisters, including monozygotic twins, with clinical, ultrastructural, and histochemical features typical of yellow mutant albinism. Classic tyrosinase-negative albinism was found in a maternal cousin of the probands. The authors suggested that the probands are genetic compounds for the yellow mutant allele and the classic albinism allele.\n\n{9:King et al. (1986)} reported 3 families in which affected individuals had white hair and no skin or eye pigment at birth, but developed minimal amounts of pigment in the iris in the first decade of life. They had no measurable hairbulb tyrosinase activity. The authors referred to this as 'minimal pigment' type albinism. In each of the families, one parent had normal tyrosinase activity and the other abnormally low activity. {7:King et al. (2001)} stated that early descriptions of 'minimal pigment' and 'platinum'-type albinism are now considered likely to be part of the OCA1B spectrum.\n\n<Subhead> Temperature-sensitive Phenotype\n\n{8:King et al. (1991)} reported a patient with white hair in the warmer areas (scalp and axilla) and progressively darker hair in the cooler areas (extremities) of her body.

(1981)} gave a revised (and corrected) table of proposed genotypes of oculocutaneous albinism involving the c-locus.\n\nIn a patient with yellow OCA, {11:Spritz et al.
