The condition appeared to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with incomplete penetrance. Seven patients had paraganglioma, 4 had paraganglioma and gastric stromal sarcoma, and 1 had gastric stromal sarcoma. The tumors were multicentric (paraganglioma), multifocal (gastric stromal sarcoma), and of early onset. The average age of the patients was 23 years. Based on these observations, the authors suggested that there is a familial syndrome consisting of gastric sarcoma and paraganglioma, which should be considered distinct from the Carney triad ({604287}).\n\n{1:Boccon-Gibod et al. (2004)} reported a 12-year-old boy who presented with abdominal pain and underwent surgical removal of a paraganglioma of the organ of Zuckerkandl; the following year, his 13-year-old monozygotic twin was found to have a gastric stromal tumor with hepatic metastases for which he underwent chemotherapy followed by surgical removal and radiotherapy. Both twins were alive at age 18; the first was apparently free of disease, and the second had stable hepatic and peritoneal lesions with no evidence of paraganglioma. The parents and an older sister had no history of tumors or other unusual conditions.
