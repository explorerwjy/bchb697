Radiologically, the vertebral bodies were H-shaped in frontal projection, and the femurs were shaped like telephone receivers. {31:Maroteaux et al.

The spine showed severe platyspondyly with H-shaped vertebrae and narrowing of the interpediculate distance. The thorax was small with short ribs, and the iliac bones were short and wide. Macrocrania and frontal bossing were observed; there was no evidence of a cloverleaf skull. Postmortem examination showed cerebral cortical malformations with temporal lobe polymicrogyria and severe disorganization of growth plates in the long bones. Genetic analysis identified heterozygosity for 2 de novo missense mutations in the FGFR3 gene on the same allele (N540K and Q485R; {134934.0034}).

They suggested an empiric recurrence risk in sibs of 2%. {34:McKusick (1973)} suggested genetic heterogeneity, with some recessive and many dominant new mutation cases.\n\n{4:Bouvet et al. (1974)} found no increase in parental age and no increase in parental consanguinity among patients with thanatophoric dwarfism. They pictured concordantly affected twins.\n\n{48:Serville et al. (1984)} reported identical twins who were both affected, bringing to 4 the number of such cases. This was in distinct contrast to the rarity of affected nontwin sibs; only {4:Bouvet et al. (1974)} and {39:Partington et al. (1971)} had described such cases, and thanatophoric dysplasia was associated with cloverleaf skull in the latter cases, consistent with TD2. {11:Corsello et al.

(1994)} noted that fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (FGFR3; {134934}), which is mutant in achondroplasia, is structurally very similar to FGFR2. Their observation that FGFR2 mutations cause craniosynostosis suggested to them that the lethal skeletal disorder TD2 with cloverleaf skull ({187601}) may be a good candidate for further mutation searches in FGFR3. Furthermore, because of the phenotypic similarities between TD and homozygous achondroplasia, Arthur Beaudet independently suggested to {56:Wasmuth (1995)} that FGFR3 be studied in cases of TD. Indeed, {52:Tavormina et al. (1995)} found that 23 of 39 TD1 patients harbored amino acid substitutions in the extracellular domain of FGFR3. Of these, 22 patients were found to be heterozygous for the R248C substitution ({134934.0005}). One patient had a S371C substitution ({134934.0006}). Phenotypic heterogeneity was observed in TD1, in that 6 of 11 TD1 patients with cloverleaf skull and 16 of 28 patients without cloverleaf skull had the R248C mutation.\n\nIn addition, {52:Tavormina et al. (1995)} found that all 16 patients with TD2 had a heterozygous K650E substitution ({134934.0004}). All 16 patients with TD2 had severe cloverleaf skull deformity with straight femurs. In a subsequent paper, {51:Tavormina et al. (1995)} identified a S249C mutation ({134934.0013}) in 4 cases of TD1. The authors proposed that the severe lethal phenotype in TD1 was more directly related to the introduction of a new cysteine residue than to the specific site of the amino acid substitution. They speculated that an unpaired cysteine residue in the cytoplasmic region of the protein may result in formation of intermolecular disulfide hybrids between two FGFR3 monomers, resulting in a constitutively active mutant receptor homodimer complex.\n\n{43:Rousseau et al. (1996)} performed FGFR3 mutation analysis in 26 cases of TD1. Three missense mutations (Y373C, {134934.0016}; R248C, {134934.0005}; S249C, {134934.0013}) accounted for 73% of the cases. Two stop codon mutations (X807R, {134934.0008}; X807C, {134934.0009}) and 1 rare G370C mutation were also found. {43:Rousseau et al. (1996)} noted that all reported missense mutations created cysteine residues and were located in the extracellular domain of the receptor. The findings provided support for the hypothesis that the newly created cysteine residues may allow disulfide bonds to form between the extracellular domains of mutant monomers, thus inducing constitutive activation of the homodimer receptor complex.\n\n{5:Brodie et al. (1999)} examined 22 cases of thanatophoric dysplasia variants for the presence of missense mutations in FGFR3. All 17 cases of the San Diego variant (originally called the San Diego form of lethal short-limbed platyspondylic dysplasia) were heterozygous for the same FGFR3 mutations found in TD1; the R248C mutation was present in 7 of the 17 cases. Large inclusion bodies were found in all 14 cases of the San Diego type in which they were sought. Similar inclusion bodies were present in 2 of 72 thanatophoric dysplasia type I cases, but not in 39 controls. The material retained within the rough endoplasmic reticulum stained only with antibody to the FGFR3 protein. No mutations were identified in patients with the Torrance and Luton types of TD ({151210}). {5:Brodie et al. (1999)} suggested that the radiographic and cellular differences between thanatophoric dysplasia and the San Diego variant may be a consequence of other genetic factors, perhaps in the processing of mutant FGFR3 molecules within the rough endoplasmic reticulum. {16:Hall (2002)} noted that the San Diego form of platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasia (PLSD) described by {22:Horton et al.

These data suggest that thanatophoric dysplasia is one-third to one-half as frequent as achondroplasia. The differences on the prevalence of these conditions across monitoring programs were consistent with random fluctuation.
